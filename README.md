 # Crypto Reference Notes

 This repository collects quick-reference summaries for foundational cryptography topics. Each markdown file focuses on a different pillar of modern cryptography and is designed to provide concise tables, recommendations, and references.

 ## Contents

 - `symm.md` — symmetric (shared-key) encryption algorithms, recommended modes, and best practices.
 - `asymm.md` — asymmetric (public-key) algorithms, key exchange mechanisms, and post-quantum options.
 - `hashing.md` — cryptographic hash functions, password hashing guidance, and known attacks.

 ## How to Use These Notes

 - Use the tables for a high-level comparison of algorithms, their key sizes, and current security status.
 - Refer to the recommendations sections when selecting primitives for new systems or audits.
 - Follow the linked standards (NIST, RFCs, etc.) for deeper study or implementation details.

 ## Contributing

 Contributions are welcome. If you spot an inaccuracy or want to extend a summary:

 1. Open an issue describing the proposed change.
 2. Submit a pull request updating the relevant markdown file.
 3. Include citations (standards, academic papers, vendor guidance) for any new claims.
